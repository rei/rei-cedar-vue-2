## <span class="usage">Usage</span>

```
  <cdr-cta
    tag="a"
    href="https://rei.com"
  >Learn More</cdr-cta>
```

`cdr-cta` can render as a button or an anchor element. The default is a button. 

The `cta-style` prop will allow you to change the color to match different themes. Accepted values are `brand`, `dark`, `light`, and `sale`.

```
  <cdr-cta
    tag="a"
    cta-style="sale"
    href="https://rei.com"
  >Learn More</cdr-cta>
```

## <span class="accessibility">Accessibility</span>

Since `cdr-cta` can render as a button or an anchor, users should focus on what the semantically correct element would be. It will always look like a call to action button, so as long as the correct semantic choice is made, the default ARIA context should suffice. 

## <span class="">Installation</span>

Import the component to use it in your application.
