# <span class="display-name">CdrButton</span>

### <span class="modifiers">Modifiers</span>

Modifiers can be combined 1 from each grouping.

{secondary} | {sm,xs} | {block, fixed, responsive} **OR** link

Use of the 'link' modifier depends on including the css for cdrA.

A modifier list that contains 'link' exposes the same modifiers as cdrA and the other modifiers shouldn't be combined with it.

Responsive makes the button full width and block @ sm breakpoint.
