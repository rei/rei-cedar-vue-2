    <blockquote>
        <p>UI Collections are groups of elements bonded together, which take on new properties as a result.</p>
        <p>In interfaces, collections are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button element can combine together to form a search form collection.</p>
        <p>They may include and extend other UI Elements for use in certain contexts—for example form may extend input as well as include their own content.</p>
        <p>Building up from elements to collections encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality, and encourages creating reusable interface patterns.</p>
