    <p>Currently, some of the default color combinations available in Bootstrap (such as the various
        <a href="../elements/buttons/">styled button</a> classes, some of the code highlighting colors used for
        <a href="../css/#code-block">basic code blocks</a>, the <code>.bg-primary</code>
        <a href="../css/#helper-classes-backgrounds">contextual background</a> helper class, and the default link color
        when used on a white background) have a low contrast ratio (below the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast">recommended ratio of 4.5:1</a>). This can
        cause problems to users with low vision or who are color blind. These default colors may need to be modified to
        increase their contrast and legibility.</p>
